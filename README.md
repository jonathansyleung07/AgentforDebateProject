# AgentforDebateProject

Users post points or counterpoints freely with no turn order. A single AI agent ingests each submission, classifies it, links counters to targeted points, updates an argument ledger, and continuously produces a consolidated, neutral ‘current picture’ of the debate, plus a rubric-based evaluation and (on request) a judgment of which side’s argument is currently stronger.
