# Research Notes: Addressing Potential Mass Unemployment in the Post-AI Era

## Introduction
- The rapid advancement of AI technologies raises concerns about mass unemployment due to automation and job displacement.
- Importance of proactive policies and a robust social safety net to mitigate negative impacts on the workforce.

## Evidence of Potential Mass Unemployment
- **Historical Precedents**: Technological revolutions have historically led to job displacements (e.g., Industrial Revolution).
